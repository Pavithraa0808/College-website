            <img src="image/about img.jpg" alt="">
            <h4>A Star is Born.......</h4>
            <p class="pa">The RMK group of educational institutions began their educational services in the early nineties and for the past 25 years it is their sustained hard work and dedication that has carved on niche in the field of engineering education. RMK College of Engineering and Technology was established in 2008.</p>
            <p class="pa">The motto of the college is very lofty. Safety and security is given top priority, then impeccable discipline. All are provided with good food, when these are made available engineering education becomes a child’s play. Teachers carefully nurture the young ones in the field of engineering and their mode of inspiring the students is available only here.</p>
            <p class="pa">RMK college of engineering spares no effort however tough or small it may be in elevating the educational quality, the bearing and orientation of the engineers that are molded, shaped and polished to be the young visionaries of the future of mankind.</p>
            <video autoplay loop muted src="RMKCET.mp4"></video>
            <p class="pa">The education process is excellent and the placement is enviable. We give training in engineering skills, not only that-we have centers of excellence where the college and top notch companies give training in various fields even before they get their placement. Unmindful of the expenses involved, the management pours millions into the training and placement aspects of the students. This makes the college unique.</p>
            <p class="pa">There are a number of buses to bring the students safely from home to college and leave them home in the evening. The food is very good. The discipline is unparalleled and this creates an educational ambience in the midst of the greenery unequalled. The teachers are well qualified-many are gold medal holders in their branches, and all are dedicated. Not a day passes without some achievement or the other.</p>
            <p class="pa">The college infrastructure, staff, amenities and the ambience and finally the placement record draws the children and the parents to our institution.</p>
            <p class="pa">This college has a focused and clear vision. The missions are made purposefully possible and the quality policy is strictly adhered to. All this makes the students achieve their objective comfortably and with cheer. The cutting edge technology makes the students ready to take on any tough task and finish it with dedication.</p>
            <p class="pa">Awards for the college, staff and students come in great numbers and our college has become one of the engineering colleges in the country to reckon with. We do not rest on our laurels. We know we have miles to go and-Go we will!</p>
